JS: Basic
1. Difference between var, let and const in javascript?
  - All var, let and const are used to declare the variable in JS
  - Variable defined using var has a function scope.
  - Variable defined using let and const has a blocked scope.
  - Variable defined using const cannot be modified.

2. What are JS engine?
  - JS engine are used to convert the high level code that JS code into machine-readable code(ByteCode)
  - In chrome it has v8 engine 
  - FireFox it has SpiderMonkey engine.
  - IE has Chakra engine
  - Safari has JavaScriptCore engine

3. In how many ways you can create an object?
  - Constructor: Constructor is nothing but a function and with the help of new keyword, constructor
                function allows to create multiple objects
  - Object literals: We simply define the property and values inside the curly braces.
  - Object.create(): Object.create() method creates the new object using the existing object as the prototype.
  - class: ES6 supports class concepts similar to object oriented language, so object can be created out of the
          class in JS as well.
 

4. Ways to clone object in JS?
  - There 3 ways to clone the object:
    - Spread Operator: [...array/object]
    - Object.assign method: Object.assign({}, obj1);
    - Using JSON: JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object))
   
5. What is Shallow copy and Deep copy in JS?
  - Shallow copy: It means only the first level of object/Array is copied, deeper level are referenced.
                 - Spread Operator and Object.assign does the shallow copy of object/array.
  - Deep Copy: It is a true copy where all the nested object is also copied.
                 - JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object));
				 
6. What is this keywork in JS?
  - 'this' stores the current execution context of the javascript program
  - 'this' keywork behave deferently base on the function invocation
  - 3 types of function invocation:
	  - Function Invocation:
      - here 'this' refers to the Global context.
	  - Method Invocation:
	    - when any function is invoked form the object it is know as method invocation.
	      Eg: personObj.printInfo()
		    here 'this' refers to the object which used to call the method.
	  - Constructor Invocation:
	    - Constructor Invocation is performed when 'new' keyword is used followed by the function name
	      - let personObject = new Person('Zameer', 'Inamdar');
	
 
JS: Level 2

1. What are Transpilers and Polyfills?
  - Transpilers: It is library which translate the source code to another source code.
                It parse the modern code and rewrite the it using older syntax construct so that it can run in older browser:
				Babel is one of the most prominent transpilers
				Modern project build systems, such as webpack, provide means to run transpiler automatically on every code change, so it’s very easy to integrate into development process.
				eg: 
				// before running the transpiler // nullish coalescing operator
				height = height ?? 100;

				// after running the transpiler
				height = (height !== undefined && height !== null) ? height : 100;

  - Polyfills: The script that updates/add new functions so that it can be run without errors in old browser.
              eg:
			  if (!Math.trunc) { // if no such function
				  // implement it
				  Math.trunc = function(number) {
					// Math.ceil and Math.floor exist even in ancient JavaScript engines
					// they are covered later in the tutorial
					return number < 0 ? Math.ceil(number) : Math.floor(number);
				  };
				}
			  'core js' that supports a lot, allows to include only needed features.
              'polyfill.io' service that provides a script with polyfills, depending on the features and user’s browser. 

2. 	What is Call, Apply and Bind in JS OR What is Function borrowing?
  - Function borrowing: Function borrowing allows us to use the methods of one object on a different object without having to make a copy of that 
    method.
  - Call:  It invokes the function and allows you to pass the arguments one by one.
  - Apply: It invokes the function and allows you to pass the arguments as an array.
  - Bind:  It returns a new function and allows you to pass the any number of arguments as array.
 
3. What are Map, Reduce and Filter Array functions in JS?
  - Map, Reduce and Filter are Array functions which transforms the array according to the applied function.
  - Map:  It applies a given function on all the elements of the Array and return the updated Array
  - Reduce: It reduces all the elements of the Array to the single value by repeatedly applying a function 
  - Filter: It filters the elements from Array and return array of element which statisfy the condition.

4. What is closure in JS?
  - Closure is the combination of a function bundled together with reference to its surrounding state(the lexical enviournemnt)

5. What is IIFE or Self Exceuting Anonymous Function?
  - IIFE is 'Immediately Invoking Expression' is JS function that run as soon as it is defined.
  - It is also known as design pattern as 'Self Exceuting Anonymous Function'
    - It contains two parts:
      - The first one is the anonymous function with lexical scope enclosed in ()
	    - It prevents accessing variables within the IIFE as well as polluting the global scope.
	  - The second part creates the immediate invoked function expression () through which JS engine will directly interpret the function.

6. encoding & decoding of data?
  - When data needs to be transferred in API we can use data encoding and decoding we need to decode the data from the API.
    - Encoding btoa(): Binary to ASCII
    - Decoding atob(): ASCII to Binary.

7. What are spread operator and rest operator?
  - Spread operator: It expands an array into elements
  - Rest operator: collects multiple element and condenses it to single element
 
7. WebAPI methods eg setTimeOut

8. web workers vs service workers
- async await
- export default

9.  Curring Functions eg: sum()()()()()?
10. Polyfills for reduce function

JS: Design Patterns
1. What is Modular Design Pattern? https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-javascript-design/9781449334840/ch09s02.html
  - Modular Pattern is used to emulate the concept of classes in such a way that we are able to include both Private/Public methods or variables
    in a single object, thus shielding particular parts from global scope.

2. What is Singleton Design Pattern?

3. What is Factory Design Pattern?
